## BUILD LOG

## 2025 WORK THEOREM
- Monday & Friday: Betterment of overall system
- Tues, Wed, Thurs: Client/Feature-specific development


This week:

- Simple Python app/site upload test to a "normal" web server, to discover the process / steps
- Wrap up Song Contest script & code
- Progress details in Pitch, more on product / process
- Progress Surveys element for clients & research
- Further investor, accelerator and grant research (test AISA web crawl)


This month:

- Blueprints for different feature sets (e.g. Songcontest, CMS, messaging, shop, AI features, etc)
- Client: Planning of animated scoreboard.
- CMS established to setup/maintain basic sites: ANIMISM, GLOA/Lab, Plan Sea Book


-----
## Mon. March 3 2025 ## 2+ hours
- Preliminary Python-compatible server checks (JetHostPRO, Vultr, Cloudstick) and hosting backup plan
- Working on alternative, PY-based process for the close results script. (PHP script as backup for Thursday)
- Several positive attempts at script, but the logic still isn't being executed properly



-----
## Mon. Feb. 24 2025 ## 3 hours
- Progressed extended version of pitch deck, with Short Operations Timeline & other tweaks
- Progressed eventual Business Plan, with details on Radical Transparency & Open Governance
- Ongoing research into Singapore company options & services

## Tue. Feb. 25 2025 ## 3 hours
- Progressed extended version of pitch deck, with Sales Funnel
- Song Contest: Finish-up plan, remaining tasks, deployment & testing strategy

## Wed. Feb. 26 2025 ## 1.5 hours
- Followed up with Outlier re: last week's meeting, next steps
- Rotated Github token - 
- Updated daily_update script - should make separate one to start updating super agency (once rebuilding main script is in place) << need to finish properly
- 11am FRRO appointment at Pernem Police Station adjourned any morning programming
- Was invited to apply to another Accelerator, weighing options of concurrent applications

## Thu. Feb. 27 2025 ## 3 hours
- Took forever, but fixed Github daily update, with new token (initial security breach, ChatGPT confusion)
- Resumed programming, which has been a struggle to regain focus/momentum after a lengthy break (due to pitch decks, etc). Qwen Coder on Ollama is showing some limitations, and it's taking some time to become accustomed with it
- Creating SongShowCountries admin route, to be able to change the order of countries in a show, installing necessary dependences, etc
- Still too many considerations, and Qwen coder is not as reliable as the original DeepSeek I used to make good progress. Programming brain is warmed up again, but will need to continue this on Friday.

## Fri. Feb. 28 2025 ##  4 hours
- Supremely disappointed in localhost coding assistants (QwenCoder, DeepSeekCoder) where they can't keep our entire working code base in memory, to then help with development from there. Results in a lot of redundant and inconsistent information, that wastes a lot of time.
- After some issues, was able to create test route for Results Script, displaying in html template
- Then, more and more delays and misunderstandings, as QwenCoder is stalling the project, like ChatGPT was
- Looking into alternatives for memory-storing, like RAG, vector database, simple JSON snippets, etc
- Reverted to a simpler version, will attempt Scripts again next week. Big week ahead to wrap up song contest.



-----
## Mon. Feb. 17 2025 ##  4+ hours
- Finished touching up slides ahead of Outlier meeting
- Positive meeting with Matthew @ Outlier, following presenting AISA pitch for the first time

## Tue. Feb. 18 2025 ##  5+ hours
- Downloaded and installed various coder assistants - Qwen vs Deepseek-Coder. Finding Qwen faster, more useful and better understanding already.
- Will continue to develop my Python-Flask demo, but will likely rebuild from scratch upon onboarding a seasoned Python programmer, now that I know what needs to be done, and how
- I'm confident we can resume regular programming from tomorrow, unless there is a new meeting scheduled to further discuss Super Agency.
- Long weekly meeting with Jarred (2 1/2 hours), including presenting the pitch to him. Good feedback!

## Wed. Feb. 19 2025 ##  2+ hours
- Revisited original Song Contest, scouring voting results script, and clarifying some points with Glynn
- Becoming more familiar with Qwen coder on the local machine. Still finding its limitations. It's also not as polite and friendly as DeepSeek, which is a note on future customisation of conversational styles for clients.
- Discussing with QwenCoder, options for the forthcoming CMS feature, where pages and layout can be managed through more Conversational approaches

## Fri. Feb. 21 2025 ##  2+ hours
- Referring to Song Contest voting script, preparing to finish off next week
- Advice from AdLunam about project value, researching valuations of other AI-type fundraising campaigns

- Installed Docker locally, but issues connecting to the server (will try again tomorrow)
- Too slow to progress programming reliably on cloud-hosted DeepSeek
- Placed view_survey.html in main /templates folder as a test, and now it's working. Form fields need to be edited, made larger, etc
- Survey form posted properly, filling up the Survey Responses DB. Definitely needs formatting

## Wed. Feb. 12 2025 ##  2+ hours
- Progressed pitch deck, dialling in TAM, SAM & SOM

## Thu. Feb. 13 2025 ##  4+ hours

- Looking for full programming day on Thursday (today has some domestic/registration priorities)

## Thu. Feb. 6 2025 ##  2 hours
- Increasing Server Busy delays on DeepSeek, with new "You are sending too many messages" warnings
- This is stunting programming progress to the point of considering custom API or other services for now
- Between this and rescheduled FRRO appointment, today will not be a full programming day
- Instead, progressing pitch deck
- Back to Surveys - internal server error due to enum field/options (expecting 4 values, finding 3)

## Fri. Feb. 7 2025 ##  hours
- Despite slow DeepSeek again, was able to remedy Internal Server Error, to proceed with Questions
- Continued research for accelerator application, sourcing realistic Competitors
- Wrote to Outlier Ventures (via LinkedIn) to confirm actual application deadline (if not Feb. 14)
- Successfully populated the opening round of survey questions to find and onboard new clients (with some technical / setup issues, such as select options)
- Looks like several survey blueprint issues related to json, public display of surveys, etc
- Feedback from Song Contest: Looks great, aiming for March 9 tests (week before dress rehearsal)
- Updated pip and installed wtforms_sqlalchemy. Used research to help pinpoint small issue in the interim.

Next week:

- SUBMIT OUTLIER APPLICATION!
- Solve Survey issues, improve UI/UX for prospects, and share across personal/professional networks
- Song Contest: Finish script / results, change order of countries, share with Glynn for feedback (later sessions/cookies for 1 vote each)

- Slight tweaks to voting code in views.py, to ensure empty options are not selected
- General HTML touching up, while looking into bp-specific templates overriding defaults as necessary

## Fri. Jan. 31 2025 ## 2.5 hours
- Overriding master AISA layout templates with blueprint-specific files
- Have completely stalled trying to ascertain while the bp/templates/layout.html isn't loading
- Noticed that the system seems to be reversed: first checking the master templates folder, and then when could not find layout.html (I renamed the master one to layoutOLD), it then loads the blueprint template

- Spent 2+ hours trying and failing to reset MySQL root password, reinstall, and load phpmyadmin
- Split up app.py into multiple files and routes, with inconsistent success/failure. Not sure it worked
- Many blank screens, server restarts, unsuccessful data prints, etc
- Day was a failure. Did not accomplish simple login mission.
- Reminder that my role is to develop the MVP. Any further funding would onboard the Dev/s we need.

// back from Bangkok, following 2+ weeks of networking & research
// Noting that none of the world in September/October seems to have been logged

## Thu. Aug 8 2024 - c.2 hours
- Researched Models and more, in the HF documentation
- Initiated a document about Page Builder / Self-Help app, plotting out schematics for a CMS
- Researched VULTR server specs required to deploy AI-based applications

Problem: Cost-prohibitive, high-spec GPU/RAM machines required to deploy and dev applications


## Wed. Aug 7 2024 - c.4 hours
- Successfully set up API access to update page on VULTR server
- Successfully installed Hugging Face / API library for AI text generation, and updating the page.

Problem: Model did not follow the prompt instructions, specifically to change the tour dates. It DID follow the instructions to replace all existing text with a message, but then auto-generated its own text at the bottom

Solutions:
- Simpler exercises to start
- Replacing clearly-indicated areas, such as JSON fields or input areas
- Might not need AI at this point, to generate a CMS-updating script
