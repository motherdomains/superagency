## Mon. Feb. 24 2025 ## 3 hours
- Progressed extended version of pitch deck, with Short Operations Timeline & other tweaks
- Progressed eventual Business Plan, with details on Radical Transparency & Open Governance
- Ongoing research into Singapore company options & services

## Tue. Feb. 25 2025 ## 3 hours
- Progressed extended version of pitch deck, with Sales Funnel

## Wed. Feb. 26 2025 ## 1.5 hours
- Followed up with Outlier re: last week's meeting, next steps
- Rotated Github token - 
- Updated daily_update script - should make separate one to start updating super agency (once rebuilding main script is in place) << need to finish properly
- 11am FRRO appointment at Pernem Police Station adjourned any morning programming
- Was invited to apply to another Accelerator, weighing options of concurrent applications

## Thu. Feb. 27 2025 ## 3 hours
- Took forever, but fixed Github daily update, with new token (initial security breach, ChatGPT confusion)
- Resumed programming, which has been a struggle to regain focus/momentum after a lengthy break (due to pitch decks, etc). Qwen Coder on Ollama is showing some limitations, and it's taking some time to become accustomed with it
- Creating SongShowCountries admin route, to be able to change the order of countries in a show, installing necessary dependences, etc
- Still too many considerations, and Qwen coder is not as reliable as the original DeepSeek I used to make good progress. Programming brain is warmed up again, but will need to continue this on Friday.

## Fri. Feb. 28 2025 ##  4 hours
- Supremely disappointed in localhost coding assistants (QwenCoder, DeepSeekCoder) where they can't keep our entire working code base in memory, to then help with development from there. Results in a lot of redundant and inconsistent information, that wastes a lot of time.
- After some issues, was able to create test route for Results Script, displaying in html template
- Then, more and more delays and misunderstandings, as QwenCoder is stalling the project, like ChatGPT was
- Looking into alternatives for memory-storing, like RAG, vector database, simple JSON snippets, etc
- Reverted to a simpler version, will attempt Scripts again next week. Big week ahead to wrap up song contest.

- Positive meeting with Matthew @ Outlier, following presenting AISA pitch for the first time

## Tue. Feb. 18 2025 ##  5+ hours
- Downloaded and installed various coder assistants - Qwen vs Deepseek-Coder. Finding Qwen faster, more useful and better understanding already.
- Will continue to develop my Python-Flask demo, but will likely rebuild from scratch upon onboarding a seasoned Python programmer, now that I know what needs to be done, and how
- I'm confident we can resume regular programming from tomorrow, unless there is a new meeting scheduled to further discuss Super Agency.
- Long weekly meeting with Jarred (2 1/2 hours), including presenting the pitch to him. Good feedback!

## Wed. Feb. 19 2025 ##  2+ hours
- Revisited original Song Contest, scouring voting results script, and clarifying some points with Glynn
- Becoming more familiar with Qwen coder on the local machine. Still finding its limitations. It's also not as polite and friendly as DeepSeek, which is a note on future customisation of conversational styles for clients.
- Discussing with QwenCoder, options for the forthcoming CMS feature, where pages and layout can be managed through more Conversational approaches

## Fri. Feb. 21 2025 ##  2+ hours

- Progressed pitch deck, dialling in TAM, SAM & SOM

- Continued research for accelerator application, sourcing realistic Competitors
- Wrote to Outlier Ventures (via LinkedIn) to confirm actual application deadline (if not Feb. 14)
- Successfully populated the opening round of survey questions to find and onboard new clients (with some technical / setup issues, such as select options)
- Looks like several survey blueprint issues related to json, public display of surveys, etc
- Feedback from Song Contest: Looks great, aiming for March 9 tests (week before dress rehearsal)

Next week:

- General HTML touching up, while looking into bp-specific templates overriding defaults as necessary

## Fri. Jan. 31 2025 ## 2.5 hours
- Overriding master AISA layout templates with blueprint-specific files
- Have completely stalled trying to ascertain while the bp/templates/layout.html isn't loading
- Noticed that the system seems to be reversed: first checking the master templates folder, and then when could not find layout.html (I renamed the master one to layoutOLD), it then loads the blueprint template

## Thu. Aug 8 2024 - c.2 hours
- Researched Models and more, in the HF documentation
- Initiated a document about Page Builder / Self-Help app, plotting out schematics for a CMS
- Researched VULTR server specs required to deploy AI-based applications

Problem: Cost-prohibitive, high-spec GPU/RAM machines required to deploy and dev applications


## Wed. Aug 7 2024 - c.4 hours
- Successfully set up API access to update page on VULTR server
- Successfully installed Hugging Face / API library for AI text generation, and updating the page.

Problem: Model did not follow the prompt instructions, specifically to change the tour dates. It DID follow the instructions to replace all existing text with a message, but then auto-generated its own text at the bottom

Solutions:
- Simpler exercises to start
- Replacing clearly-indicated areas, such as JSON fields or input areas
- Might not need AI at this point, to generate a CMS-updating script
